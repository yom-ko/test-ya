FYI: This project uses a free Timetable API from Aviation Edge which (if i got it right) is limited to 100 calls per month. So if the flight list isn't loaded at all, the calls are probably exhausted. Please, take care.

Key libs used in this project:

- View Layer - React (react + react-dom)
- Styling:
  - UI Lib - Reactstrap (reactstrap)
  - CSS Framework - Bootstrap (bootstrap)
- Utilities - Moment.js
